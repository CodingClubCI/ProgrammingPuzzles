Programming Puzzles
========
Within this repository, You can create programming problems and/or solutions to these problems. The hope is to collaborate, learn, share and broaden your programming eloquence, focusing on the arithmatic part of programming apose to just the syntax. 

Anyone can create programming problems, as well as solve them. Concider this project as the C of I version of `LeetCode.` 

## Get Started:
<b>Create Puzzles:</b>

Open the `problems` directory and browse through the different puzzles.
All of the folders within this directory contain a `README.md` file, listing the following:
-   Description 
-   Examples & Explainations
-   Constraints

Example of `README.MD`:

    Title: Add Two Integers

    Description: Given two integers num1 and num2, return the sum of the two integers.
    
    Example 1:
    Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
    Output: 17
    Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.
    
    Example 2:
    Input: num1 = -10, num2 = 4
    Output: -6
    Explanation: num1 + num2 = -6, so -6 is returned.

    Constraints: -100 <= num1, num2 <= 100


Next your Problem should contain a .json or .txt file containing the correct test cases, an example of a test case may look like:

<i>Sorting Algorithm:</i>
    
    Input:[3,4,2,1] Output: [1,2,3,4]

<i>Find Minimum in List:</i>
    
    Input:[5,2,3,4] Output: 2

The Full File Structure should look like this:

    ./problems/
              /Add Two Integers
                README.MD
                TestCases.json
                /solutions (PLACE YOUR SUBMISSIONS IN HERE)
                    ExampleSolution.py
                    ExampleSolution.java
